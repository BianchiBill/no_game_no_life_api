  `No Game No Life\n
In this fantasy world, everything's a game--and these gamer siblings play to win! Meet Sora and Shiro, a brother and sister who are loser shut-ins by normal standards. But these siblings don't play by the rules of the "crappy game" that is average society. In the world of gaming, this genius pair reigns supreme, their invincible avatar so famous that it's the stuff of urban legend. So when a young boy calling himself God summons the siblings to a fantastic alternate world where war is forbidden and all conflicts--even those involving national borders--are decided by the outcome of games, Sora and Shiro have pretty much hit the jackpot. But they soon learn that in this world, humanity, cornered and outnumbered by other species, survives within the confines of one city. Will Sora and Shiro, two failures at life, turn out to be the saviors of mankind? Let the games begin...!`;

  history: 'Abandoned by his parents, Sora is a brilliant NEET (Not in Education, Employment, or Training) hikikomori (shut-in) gamer along with his stepsister, Shiro. He does not take life very seriously and is pretty much a good-for-nothing gamer. One day, he and his sister are called into an alternate world and they have to become Saviors of Humanity!\nDespite being a NEET and a shut-in, Sora is extremely outgoing and confident, and is not afraid to play games with people face to face, even when they\'re cheating. He is also extremely manipulative - which he refers to as using negotiating skills. This fits in with his play style as while Shiro is excellent at logic and computing, Sora can read people and predict what their next move is, using this knowledge to beat them.\nHowever, if he is separated from Shiro by so much as a closed door he becomes a spineless, cowardly wreck, and only returns to his former self if he is able to see her. He views his sister as his equal and partner, but is also protective of her, shown by actions such as putting his body between her and the ground when he thought they were going to hit hard when first arriving on Disboard.\nSora is extroverted and has no problems dealing with people. While not as intelligent as Shiro, he is shown to have a brilliant IQ. Rather than computing numbers like Shiro, Sora can rapidly compute what his opponents are going to do based on observing their behavior and motivations.\nSora is also slightly perverted and desires a girlfriend for himself. His lust lead to a linguistic mistake that causes Stephanie to fall in love with him and causes him to receive a scolding from Shiro.',
